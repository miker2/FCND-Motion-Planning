## Project: 3D Motion Planning

---


# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## Writeup / README

### Explain the Starter Code

Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`
These scripts contain a basic planning implementation that includes...

#### 1. `motion_planning.py`

This script is very similar to the backyard flyer script. It uses event driven programming to command the quadrotor to arm, take-off, follow waypoints, land and then disarm.

The key differences between `motion_planning.py` and `backyard_flyer.py` is that
`backyard_flyer.py` follows a fixed set of waypoints in the shape of a box and
`motion_planning.py` has an added state as part of the finite state machine that
allows for planning a path through the urban environment. While the path that is
planned in this skeleton implementation is quite simple, all of the necessary
code is present. One just needs to modify the body of the `plan_path` method.

#### 2. `planning_utilities.py`

This script contains some of the key building blocks of a path planning algorithm
that we have been developing and using in the Planning unit of this nanodegree
program. The script includes the following functions/classes:

##### A. create_grid

This is the method we have been using to generate a discretized grid based on the
obstacles described by `colliders.csv`.

##### B. Action

This is the class that has been used by the A* algorithm to describe all possible
actions that will produce a new state from a current state. This class also provides
the cost associated with that action.

##### C. valid_actions

This method prunes the list of all possible actions down to a list of valid actions
based on the configuration space (map extents and obstacle locations).

##### D. a_star

This is the basic A* algorithm suited to planning a path through a grid based
2D configuration space.

##### E. hueristic

This method provides the estimated cost from a state to a goal position. The
hueristic used here is euclidian distance.

### Implementing The Path Planning Algorithm

**Get on with it already! Go and implement your planning algorithm!**

And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.


And here is a lovely picture of our downtown San Francisco environment from above!
![Map of SF](./misc/map.png)

#### 2. Set your current local position
Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.


Meanwhile, here's a picture of me flying through the trees!

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

#### 6. Cull waypoints
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.



### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.

# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
