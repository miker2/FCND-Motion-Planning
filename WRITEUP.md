## Project: 3D Motion Planning

---


# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## Writeup / README

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. `motion_planning.py`

This script is very similar to the backyard flyer script. It uses event driven programming to command the quadrotor to arm, take-off, follow waypoints, land and then disarm.

The key differences between `motion_planning.py` and `backyard_flyer.py` is that
`backyard_flyer.py` follows a fixed set of waypoints in the shape of a box and
`motion_planning.py` has an added state as part of the finite state machine that
allows for planning a path through the urban environment. While the path that is
planned in this skeleton implementation is quite simple, all of the necessary
code is present. One just needs to modify the body of the `plan_path` method.

#### 2. `planning_utilities.py`

This script contains some of the key building blocks of a path planning algorithm
that we have been developing and using in the Planning unit of this nanodegree
program. The script includes the following functions/classes:

  1. `create_grid`  
    The method we have been using to generate a discretized grid based on the
obstacles described by `colliders.csv`.

  2. `Action`  
    The class that has been used by the A* algorithm to describe all possible
actions that will produce a new state from a current state. This class also provides
the cost associated with that action.

  3. `valid_actions`  
    This method prunes the list of all possible actions down to a list of valid actions
based on the configuration space (map extents and obstacle locations).

  4. `a_star`  
    Basic A* algorithm suited to planning a path through a grid based
2D configuration space.

  5. `heuristic`  
    Provides the estimated cost from a state to a goal position. The
heuristic used here is euclidian distance.

### Implementing The Path Planning Algorithm

**Get on with it already! Go and implement your planning algorithm!**

And here's a lovely image of my results (ok this image has nothing to do with it, but it's a nice example of how to include images in your writeup!)

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
I used the following code to read the latitude & longitude from the `colliders.csv` file.

    # Read lat0, lon0 from colliders into floating point values
    lat_lon_str = 'lat0 0, lon0 0'  # default in case file read fails.
    with open('colliders.csv') as f:
        lat_lon_str = f.readline()  # lat/lon is on the first line, so we only
				                            # need to call `readline` once.
        f.close()                   # Close the file when done!

    # The lat/lon string sort of looks like a comma separate list of key/value
    # pairs, so we'll parse it under that assumption.
    lat_lon_dict = dict(item.split() for item in lat_lon_str.split(','))
		# Convert to float:
		for k, v in lat_lon_dict.items():
		    lat_lon_dict[k] = float(v)
    # set home position to (lon0, lat0, 0)
    self.set_home_position(lat_lon_dict['lon0'],
                           lat_lon_dict['lat0'],
                           0.0)

There are many ways to parse the string into the float values including regular expressions,
splitting the string on the command and then selecting everything from the 5th character to
the end of each of the two strings, etc, but I opted for a method that would be slightly
more robust in the event that the `lat0` and `lon0` entries in the file swapped places. While
this won't happen for this project, a dictionary is still a convenient way to accessing the
information by name.

#### 2. Set your current local position
We don't actually need to set the current local position here. While we can use
`self.global_position` and `self.global_home` (which we just updated by calling
`self.set_home_position(...)`) to calculate our current local position, we can also
access the `local_position` attribute of our class to get the local position, which
is what I do. In addition, `local_position` is a read-only attribute and is not settable.

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

#### 6. Cull waypoints
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.



Meanwhile, here's a picture of me flying through the trees!

#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
